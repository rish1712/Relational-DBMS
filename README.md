# Relational-DBMS
Database System Project 
The above project is a Table Normalizer which basically calculates the present NF form of any given functional dependencies and then converts the given Functional dependencies to the next NF form untill BCNF
## Team 
1) Rishab Nahar
2) Rohan Sinha
3) Vatsal Gupta
4) Samkit Jain
## Compilation
1) Compile file using "javac Main.java"
2) Run the program using "java Main"
## Structure of Source Code
The above JAVA file contains the following classes
1) Main Class- Deals with the Input, Output and the corresponding GUI related with the same.
2) CalculateMinimal-Calculates the Minimal Closere for the following Functional Dependencies
3) Calculate Closere- Calculates the closere of the given Functional Dependencies
4) Keys- Calculates all the candidate keys of the given Functional Dependencies
5) CalculateForm- Calculates the Current NF form of the given Functional Dependencies
6) NextForm- Caluclates the Functional Dependencies of the next NF form
7) CalculateNewKey- Calculates the new Candidate Keys for the Functional Dependencies of next/new NF form
